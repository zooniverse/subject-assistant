# Zooniverse ML Subject Assistant

Machine Learning-assisted web app for processing Zooniverse Subjects.

## Usage

Intended Users:
- Zooniverse Project Owners.

Intended Purpose:
- This web app is an experiment to see if Machine Learning systems can improve
  the quality of Subjects uploaded by science teams to the Zooniverse platform.

Intended Usage:
- The web app should allow Zooniverse project owners to process their
  Zooniverse Subjects (of wildlife camera trap images) through a Machine
  Learning (ML) service.
- These Subjects are then tagged with ML-derived metadata.
- The Subjects (or a user-selected subset) + their ML-data can then be sent to
  various endpoints: for example, to a "fast retirement" Zooniverse workflow,
  or exported as a CSV for further external processing.

Requires:
- a modern web browser (e.g. Chrome 75+, Firefox 67+) and an Internet connection
- a familiarity with the [Zooniverse](https://www.zooniverse.org) crowdsourced
  research platform
- preferably, a Zooniverse project that has already been set up with Subjects
  featuring images of animal from camera traps.

How to Use:
- **TODO**
